### Design
Initial designs for application were created with Figma to give a clear goal of aesthetics and functionality of the website, for both desktop and mobile view.
### Frontend
The frontend was created with the framework React, utilising hooks, more specifically useState and useEffect, with the Navbar being created with react-router-dom and hash link for smooth transitions from one page to another. The application has been designed with responsiveness in mind, using media queries to create the Progressive Web App as well as utilising 'aos' for creating animations on scroll. In order to create and send a message to my personal email via the contact form without a backend I utilised react hook form, emailjs and react toastify.
